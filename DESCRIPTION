Description: A collection of functions related to novel methods for estimating R(t), 
  created by the lab of Professor Laura White. Currently implemented methods include 
  two-step Bayesian back-calculation and now-casting for line-list data with missing reporting delays, 
  adapted in 'STAN' from Li (2021) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009210>, 
  and calculation of time-varying reproduction number assuming a flux between various adjacent states, adapted into 'STAN' from 
  Zhou (2021) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010434>.
