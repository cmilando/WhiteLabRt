Description: A collection of functions related to novel methods for estimating R(t), created by the lab of Professor Laura White. Currently implemented methods include Temporal R(t) estimation - Two-step Bayesian back and nowcasting for linelist data with missing reporting delays, adapted in STAN from Li and White (2021) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009210>, and (2) Spatial R(t) estimation - Calculating time-varying reproduction number, R(t), assuming a flux of infectors between various adjacent states, adapted into STAN from Zhou and White (2021) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010434>.
